# Final Project

## Link
You can access my final project [here](https://github.com/parkeeeeeeeeer/computational-art-spring2024/tree/main/assignments/final).

## Five Interconnected Aspects
1. **Mouse Interaction with Sound**: When the mouse is pressed, a sound loop plays.
2. **Mouse Interaction to Stop Sound**: If the mouse is pressed while the sound loop is playing, it stops.
3. **Amplitude and Box Height Connection**: The amplitude of the sound is connected to the height of the boxes.
4. **Dynamic Ripple Effects**: If the wave sound is not playing, the boxes generate ripple effects using noise.
5. **Slider Control**: The top slider changes the height of the cube, while the bottom slider adjusts the rotation of the box.

The most interesting effect was achieved by connecting the amplitude of the sound to the height of the boxes, creating dynamic visualizations based on the audio input.

## Multimedia
1. **3D Boxes**: Utilized for the main visual component of the project.
2. **Sound**: Integrated to enhance the interactive experience.
3. **Image Texture**: Water images used within each box to simulate water effects.

## Permission for Public Sharing
I am open to having my project shared publicly for demonstrations of student work in DMTI.
